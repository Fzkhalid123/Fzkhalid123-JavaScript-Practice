8a. Let's say in the Amazon project, we have a basketball product. This product has a name of 'basketball', a price of 2095 cents. Create an object to represent this product and display it in the console.

8b. Continuing from 8a, let's say we want to increase the price by 500 cents. Use dot notation to increase the price, and display the updated object in the console.

8c. Using bracket notation, add a property 'delivery-time' to the object with the value '3 days'. Display the updated object in the console. 

8d. Create a function 'comparePrice(product1, product2)', which takes 2 products (with 'name' and 'price' properties) and returns the product that is less expensive. Create 2 products and try out the function.

8e. Create a function isSameProduct(product1, product2), which returns true if 2 products have the same values inside name and price. If not return false. Create 2 products and try out the function.

8f. Convert a string to all lowercase. example - 'Good morning'-> 'good morning'.

8g. Repeat a string many times ('test' 2 times => 'testtest').

8h. We will add localStorage to the calculator project. First, make a copy of the project from previous exercise. 
- Whenever we update the calculation, save it using .setItem()

- When the page first loads, get the calculation using .getItem() 

- Use a default value of " if a calculation doesn't exist in local storage

8i. We'll improve the coin flip game from previous exercise to be like the rock paper scissors game.
- Create 2 buttons to play the game
heads, tails

- When clicking 'heads' play the game with guess = 'heads'.

- When clicking 'tails' play the game with guess = 'tails'.

- Create a function 'playGame(guess)' to reuse the code.

8j. Create a score object { wins: 0, losses: 0 }, update the score each time after playing, and display the score in the console.

8k. Use localStorage to save and load the score (hint: you'll need to use JSON.stringify() to convert the score object to a string).
