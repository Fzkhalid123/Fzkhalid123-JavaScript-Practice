Lesson 16 Exercises - Testing

16a. In moneyTest.js, add a test case for formatCurrency (2000.4). This test checks if the code rounds down to the nearest cent. After creating the test case, re-run all the tests to see if your code is correct.

16b. Add another test case for formatCurrency() and test with a negative number (you decide which number to use). Re-run all the tests after.

16c. In cartTest.js, in the first test, add an expect(localStorage.setItem) and check if setltem received the correct values. The first value should be 'cart' and the second value should be the cart array that was saved (convert the cart array into a string using JSON.stringify since localStorage only supports saving strings).

16d. In the second test in cartTest.js, also check if localStorage.setItem() received the correct values.

16e. In cartTest.js, create a beforeEach() hook. Move the setup code spyon(localStorage, 'setItem'); inside this hook to share this code between the two tests.

16f. In orderSummaryTest.js, create an afterEach() hook. Move the cleanup code document.querySelector('.js-test-container')... inside.

16g. In orderSummaryTest.js, in each test, check if the product name is displayed correctly on the page. (In orderSummary.js.

16h. In orderSummaryTest.js, check if the product prices are displayed correctly on the page. Each price should have a $ sign in front of it.

16i. In cartTest.js, create a test suite for the removeFromCart() function.

- Mock localstorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem at the start.
- Create a test: remove a productId that is in the cart.
- Create a test: remove a productld that is not in the cart (in this case, the function should do nothing).
- In each test, check if the cart looks correct. Also, check that localStorage.setItem was called once and with the correct values.

16j. In orderSummaryTest.js, create a test for updating the delivery option.
In orderSummary.js, add a class to each delivery option element (insert the productId and deliveryOptionld into this class).

- Using the DOM, get the 3rd delivery option for the 1st product and click it.
- Using the DOM, get the <input> inside this 3rd delivery option (hint: add a class to the <input> with the productld and deliveryOptionId). Test that this <input> is now checked (the .checked property is true). Check the cart.length is correct.
- Check the first cart item's productld and deliveryOptionld are correct (the deliveryOptionld should be '3' now).
- After updating the delivery option, the payment summary should be displayed on the page. Get the shipping price and total price from the payment summary and check if they're correct ('$14.98' & '$63.50').

16k. In cartTest.js, create a test suite for updateDeliveryOption()

- Mock localStorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem at the start.
- Create a basic test: update the delivery option of a product in the cart.
- Check that the cart looks correct.
- Check localStorage.setItem was called once with the correct values.

16l. In cart.js, modify updateDeliveryOption() so if we give it a productId that is not in the cart, the function will return and do nothing (it does not update the cart and does not save to localStorage).

- Create an edge case test: update the delivery option of a product that is not in the cart.
- Check the cart looks correct and check that localStorage.setItem was not called.

16m. Modify update DeliveryOption() so if we give it a deliveryOptionld that does not exist, the function will return and do nothing. Create an edge case test: use a deliveryOptionld that does not exist. Check the cart looks correct and check that localStorage.setItem was not called.

16n. (Optional) Generally, we create tests for each file of code. Examples: money.js moneyTest.js and cart.js➡ cartTest.js
If you want more practice, choose some other files like products.js or paymentSummary.js and create tests for these. (Note: creating tests takes time so this exercise is optional. There's no solution code for this exercise, but you can check your code by re-running the tests).
