5a. Create a <script> element. Inside the <script>, create a variable called name and save your name in this variable (as a string).

5b. Continuing from 5a, display the message My name is: ${name} in the console (insert the name variable created in 5a into this message).

5c. At a restaurant you order 1 coffee ($5), 2 bagels ($3 each), and 1 soup ($9). Calculate the cost and save it in a avariable called cost.$

5d. Continuing from 5c display Cost of food: $${cost} in the console.assert

5e. Let's say the restaurant charges a 10% tax. Using the cost variable from 5c, calculate the tax and save the result in a variable.

5f. Continuing from 5e, display Tax (10%): $${tax} in the console.

5g. Continuing from 5f, calculate the total cost (cost + tax), save it in a variable called totalCost and display the message Total cost: $${totalCost} in the console.

5h. In the Cart Quantity project, add 2 more buttons +4, +5 which increase the quantity by 4 and 5 when you click them. Try using +=.

5i. In the Cart Quantity project, add a button Remove from cart, which decreases the cart quantity by 1.

5j. Add 2 buttons -2, -3, which decreases the quantity by 2 and 3.

5k. Use the shortcuts -- and -= in 5i and 5j.

5l. Add the HTML structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>). Add a <title> with the text Calculator.

5m. Create these 5 buttons 1, 2, 3, + =

5n. Create a <script>, create a variable called calculation and save an empty string inside let calculation = ''; 
(This variable will store the calculation like 1 + 2 or 11 + 2 + 2).

5o. When we click the 1 button:
  - Add the string 1 to the calculation variable: calculation +=1;
  - Display the calculation in the console: console.log(calculation).

5p. Do the same for the 2, 3, and '+' buttons (add ' + ' instead of '+')

5q. When we click the '=' button use the code: eval(calculation); 
    (eval(...)) converts the calculation string into actual math)
  - Save the result back in calculation: console.log(calculation);

5r. Create the rest of the buttons in the calculator. To creatw multiple rows of buttons     put the buttons inside <p> elements like this: 
   <p> 
        <button>1</button>
        <button>2</button>
        ...
    </p>
    <p>
        <button>4</button>
        <button>5</button>
        ...
    </p>
