Lesson 14 Exercises - Modules

In the checkout page, the header at the top always says “3 items”.
Checkout (3 items)

14a. In checkout.html, find the element that displays "3 items" and delete the text inside. It should display "Checkout ()" when the page loads. 

14b. In checkout.js, when the page loads, calculate the actual quantity of products in the cart, and display it in the header: `${quantity} items` Hints:
• In amazon.js, inside the function updateCartQuantity(), we wrote some code to calculate the cart quantity. Reuse this code.
In checkout.html, you'll need to add a class to the element so you can select it with the DOM and change the innerHTML

14c. Continuing from 14b, also calculate and display the quantity in the header when clicking "delete”.
• First, create a function updateCartQuantity() and put the code from 14b inside
Run this function when loading the page and when clicking delete (notice that this function doesn't conflict with updateCartQuantity in amazon.js because we're using modules)

14d. If we open the home page (amazon.html) notice the cart quantity in the top-right always starts at 0.
- Remove the text “0” (so the cart quantity starts as blank) Cart
- When the page loads, calculate the cart quantity and display it in the top right (reuse the updateCartQuantity function)

14e. Inside the function updateCartQuantity, we have some code that calculates the cart quantity (creates a variable, loops through the cart, and adds up all the quantities). Notice this code is repeated in checkout.js and amazon.js.
- Create a function calculateCartQuantity() and move this code into the function so we can reuse it
- Put calculateCartQuantity() inside cart.js (because this code relates to the cart) and use export/import to share it between the 2 files

We'll make "Update" interactive step-by-step.
Quantity: 5 Update Delete
14f. In checkout.js, get all the "Update" links from the page and add a "click" event listener to each link. Also, attach the productld to each link. When clicking the link, get the productld and console.log() it.

14g. Add 2 HTML elements after the "Update" link:
- An <input class="quantity-input"> (for entering a new quantity)
- A <span class="save-quantity-link">Save</span> (to save the quantity) Style the <input>
- Add the class "link-primary" to the <span>

14h. Make "Save" appear when clicking "Update"

- When clicking "Update", get the cart-item-container for the product, and add the class "is-editing-quantity" to the container (use .classList) 
- In checkout.css, style the <input> & "Save" link and add display: none; (they will be invisible at the start)
- The CSS ".is-editing-quantity .quantity-input {...}" styles elements with class "quantity-input" inside an element with class "is-editing-quantity" 
- Use this, and "display: initial;" (resets the display property) to make the <input> appear when editing the quantity. Same for the "Save" link

14i. Using similar CSS selectors as 14h, make the quantity and "Update" link disappear when editing the quantity. 

14j. Now we'll implement switching between "Update" and "Save" Quantity: 2 Update Delete
Add "click" event listeners to all "Save" links. When clicking "Save", do the opposite of "Update": get the cart-item-container for the product, and remove the class "is-editing-quantity". This should reverse all the styling that's applied when editing the quantity.

14k. When clicking "Save", use the DOM to get the quantity <input> for the product, and get the value inside (remember to convert this value to a number). This will be the new quantity of the product in the cart.

14l. In cart.js, create a function updateQuantity(productld, newQuantity) which will find a matching productld in the cart, and update its quantity to the new quantity (remember to save to storage after).
- Then, import and use this function when clicking a "Save" link

14m. Now that we've updated the quantity in the cart, the last step is to update the quantity in the HTML. Update these 2 places:
- Inside the product Quantity: 2 Update Delete
- In the header at the top Checkout (3 items)

14n. Try to come up with more features to add to the "Update" link like: • Add validation (check the new quantity is >= 0 and < 1000) • Add keyboard support (allow updating by pressing 'Enter')
